# iPLAN
In this repository there is a report on the paper iPLAN: Interactive and Procedural Layout Planning. 
The official repository can be found at the following [link](https://github.com/realcrane/iPLAN-Interactive-and-Procedural-Layout-Planning) 
## Code
Within the Code repository is the iPLAN file containing the execution of the entire pipeline; the View file used for viewing the final data and the other folders contains additional code used for other model tests.

## Data
Within data are the .mat files used for the execution of the pipeline and tests. In Data_RPLAN there are the files obtained from the RPLAN code, for obtaining the .mat files.

## Model
The model folder contains all model checkpoints used for this report.

## Result
In the results are the .mat files for each execution of the pipeline steps. Inside Output are the final pipeline images.

## Input
Within the input are the numpy tensors in png format.
